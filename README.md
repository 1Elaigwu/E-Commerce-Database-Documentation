## Overview
The e-commerce database is designed to manage products, track inventory, handle customer information, process orders, and provide insights into sales data. This documentation provides detailed information about each component of the database schema and how to interact with it.

## Database Design
The database schema includes the following tables:

- **Products**: Stores information about available products.
- **Inventory**: Tracks the quantity of each product in stock.
- **Customers**: Manages customer details such as names and emails.
- **Orders**: Captures order information including customer ID, total amount, and status.
- **OrderDetails**: Contains details of each product within an order.

Each table is linked with foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity and ensure accurate relationships between entities.

## Implementation Details
The database schema has been implemented using SQL statements compatible with MySQL. The schema supports fundamental e-commerce operations such as placing orders, updating inventory, and retrieving customer and product information.

## Usage Instructions
To interact with the e-commerce database, follow these steps:

1. **Database Setup**: Use the provided SQL scripts to create the database schema and populate initial data.
2. **Query Execution**: Use MySQL Workbench or a similar tool to execute SQL queries against the database for operations like querying product details, placing orders, and updating inventory.
3. **Data Analysis**: Utilize SQL queries to retrieve valuable insights such as total sales per product or customer order history.

## Performance Optimization
The database schema includes suggestions for performance optimization, including the creation of indexes, views for simplified queries, and stored procedures for common operations. These optimizations enhance query performance, simplify complex operations, and encapsulate common tasks into reusable code blocks.

## Database Results
The database schema and SQL operations yield results that can be analyzed for business insights, including total sales, popular products, and customer order patterns.
